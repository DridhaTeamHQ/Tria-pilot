Tria Try-On Tuning Notes
========================

Latest updates (Dec 2025):
- Face consistency: enforce "EXACT" identity preservation and no new face generation.
- Clothing consistency: pass explicit garmentDescription into Gemini and require exact garment copy.
- Pose consistency: require EXACT pose preservation (no body/arm/head changes).
- Studio presets: constrain scenarios to realistic studio-only lighting (indoor, neutral/warm) to avoid "blue hour" mixes.

How to verify quickly:
1) Select preset: Professional Studio
2) Upload person photo + clothing reference
3) Generate Try-On
Expected:
- Same face, same pose
- Clothing matches reference (color/pattern/design)
- Studio lighting looks natural and consistent (no surreal blue-hour tone)
